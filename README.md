To run this, use pythons builtin http server
`python3 -m http.server 8880`
And then in your browser you MUST go to http://localhost:8880/


ISSUES:
Tuner does not work? It is using the wrong microphone

BIG ISSUE:
You make a change to your code, but nothing changes? Its because the browser caches the js. Do ctrl f5 to reset the page AND cache. TADA!
