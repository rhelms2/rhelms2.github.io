So the plan for all of the code is to have a main.html, with a corresponding style
sheet so that the metronome, tuner, and rhythm tracker module can be arranged on
there. 

Then each module gets constructed, and init'd and renders all relevant information
in to the respective modules div. Every module requires an audioContext object, 
but there can only be one per page, so one is instantiated at the script.js scope.

The tuner module creates some webAudio API objects, and creates an analyzer node,
then the updatePitchDisplay function gets called approx once per framerate by
requestAnimationUpdate and it updates the div or the animation with the 
respective pitch class (pitch class == note) info. updatePitch Display gets 
the pitch class and proximity in cents to the note by the function 
pitchClassAndCents, which turns a pitch like 440hz into a note like A

The tuner module will have a cute n sexy visualizer function of some sort due to
Miles.

The metronome class I am still thinking through. The general gist is to use
setInterval to call scheduler about every 100ms or less. Then scheduler 
uses the web audio api to accurately schedule the respective beats. It also has an
off function that turns the metronome on and off using the button.

For a visualizer for this, we could do some sort of animation or just use a video
and change the playback speed. 

For the meat n potatoers of this project, we were hoping for a thing that records
4 bars, and shows you where you played notes versus where the metronome played,
and it would show smaller divisions.

THis will require similar machinery as the metronome, but we also need to record 
the information into a buffer, which is easy, and then process that for peaks 
above an amplitude, which I am unsure of how to do but mildly confident its doable.
 From there we need a visualizer, maybe a sideways scrollable thing.

For software structure there would be a beatAccuracy class, with function onOff to
start it. We will need a function to proccess the buffer for peaks. We will need a
function to render a visualizer using a lists of timestamps for each peack.
