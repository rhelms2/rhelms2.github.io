# Step 1 #

Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub repository page for the Metronome application. You can find it at the following URL: https://github.com/DaxLynch/MetroGnome.

# Step 2 #

Download the Repository: On the GitHub repository page, you'll see a green button labeled "Code". Click on it, and a dropdown menu will appear. From this menu, select "Download ZIP". This will download the entire repository as a compressed ZIP file to your computer.

# Step 3 #

Extract ZIP File: Once the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in your computer's downloads folder or wherever your browser saves downloaded files. Right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All" or a similar option to extract the contents of the ZIP file.

Navigate to the Project Directory: After extracting the ZIP file, you'll find a folder named [MetroGnome] Open this folder to access the project files.

# Step 4 #

Open the Project in Your Code Editor: Inside the project folder, you'll find the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the Metronome application. Open these files in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

# Step 5 #

Run a Local Server: Open your command line interface (CLI) or terminal. Navigate to the project directory using the cd command. For example, if the project folder is located on your desktop, you would use the following command:

`cd Desktop/MetroGnome`

# Step 6 #

Start a Local Server: Once you're inside the project directory, you need to start a local server to serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server. Run the following command:

`python -m http.server`

This command starts a local server on your machine. You should see output similar to:

`Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... `

# Step 7 #

Access the Application by opening your web browser and navigating to the following address:

`http://localhost:8000`
